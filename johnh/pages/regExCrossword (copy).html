			<h1> Regular Expression Crossword Explained</h1>
			<pre class="work">
					 *+	DA   .*

				A*N	|    |      |   |
				F.A	|    |      |   |
					+----+------+---+
			</pre>
			<p> A reg ex crossword is designed to help you understand how Regular Expressions work. Solving this type of crossword is very simple. All you have<br>  to do is match box with the correct letter that matches the horizontal and vertical regular expression. Try to see if you can solve it yourself (it's easy!) </p>
		<pre class="work">
					 *+	DA   .*
					+----+------+---+
				A*N	| A  |  D   | N |
				F.A	| F  |  A   | A |
					+----+------+---+
			</pre>
			<p> Here is the solution. If you got the solution wrong, make sure you understand that each box needs to meet the requirements of both regular expressions that align with that <br>box. Sometimes, there are even 2 horizontal and 2 vertical requirements! Again, it's the same idea but it is just more requirements!</p>

		<p> This is a more complicated crossword that demonstrates reg expressions better. The same process applies here, but the restrictions have changed. </p>

			<p> This is the answer. If you didn't get the right answer, make sure you look at the restrictions. </p>
